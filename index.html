      <h1>My Favorite City:</h1>
      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Erik Roempagel.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a 45 year
        old man of half asian descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother being full Korean,
        and my father being of Germanic and Polish american
        descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;My fathers family is from the <em>La Port</em> and
        <em>Mishawaka</em> Indiana areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mothers family is from
        <em>Seoul Korea</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up, my father was career military. We would
        move commaround periodically, usually every three years or
        so.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I would say I'm from the Cape Girardeau,
        MO area.&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite city also happens to be
        <strong>Cape Girardeau</strong>.
      </p>

        >
        Cape Girardeau is situated on the Mississippi River right above the
        Bootheel of Southeast Missouri, and here you can experience all four
        seasons with a distinct Spring, Summer Fall and Winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape
        Girardeau is located in the Show Me State, so if the weather isn’t to
        your taste, sit tight for 5 minutes or so for something new!

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We moved to Jackon, MO., when I was in my sophmore
        year of high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from Jackson High School in
        Jackson, MO.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is one city north of Cape Girardeau,
        along Interstate 55.&nbsp;&nbsp;We moved to Cape Girardeau one year
        later during my Junior year of High School.

        Jackson High School (also referred to as Jackson Senior High or simply
        JHS), is located in Jackson, Missouri, United States. It consists of
        grades 9–12 and was established in 1920. One of the original buildings
        of the school was called Old A. This building stood as a historical
        landmark until its demolition in 2017 as a result of the voter approved
        no tax bond, Prop J, which was passed in 2017. A new building has been
        constructed on the same ground that Old A occupied. The new building is
        made of new brick and the same limestone that was salvaged from Old A.
        On completion in 2018, the new building hosts primarily freshman
        students and has the latest classroom technology. Jackson High School is
        now a 9–12 senior high school in Southeast Missouri with a student
        population of more than 1,600 students.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended college at Southeast Missouri State
        University.&nbsp;&nbsp;There I was an Electrical Engineering major for a
        couple years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I then switched to Geoscience because I heard a
        sales pitch from my Dean about being able to get paid to go
        fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, this intrigued me.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I
        switched my major.&nbsp;&nbsp;I minored in Military science.
